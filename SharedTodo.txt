Experiment in moving VsVim to shared project files. 

This is a reaction to the recommended approach for Dev17 extension writing. 

Order of operations
- Move VsVimShared to a shared project
- Move VsSpecific into VsVimShared
    - Make sure to add the version Defines into VsVim.csproj
- Delete VsSpecific
- Add a document to the References directory to define what its role is going forward
- Removed the ISharedService interface because it's not needed anymore
- Remove support for older versions of Visual Studio. Just leave VS2019 and VS2017
- Need to think about how to handle the VsVimTest project. Does that become another shared
  project?
- Remove all TODO_SHARED
- Clean up all the #if options for old VS versions
- Delete all of the uses of "Specific" in namespaces (sign of the old code pattern)
- Release file needs to check consistentcy of all source.extension.manifest file constants
- Delete VimSpecific (doesn't seem needed anymore)
